# Day19 Summary:

## Which factors most influence antibiotic resistance?
## Which antibiotic shows the least resistance?

### Factors to evaluate:-

- Bacteria Name
- Antibiotic Name
- Ward/Infection site
- Age

#### Bacteria Name :

##### Findings:

- Escherichia Coli appears most frequently. (35.99%)

- High resistance across multiple antibiotics.

- Shows resistance in multiple wards.

##### Interpretation:

- Same bacteria resisting many drugs → strong resistance behavior

##### Conclusion:

- Bacteria type strongly influences resistance.

#### Antibiotic Name:

- Meropenam shows high resistance across bacteria(36.70%).

- Ciprofolxacin and Ceftriaxone also shows high resistance.

- Resistance pattern are relatively consistent among antibiotics.

##### Interpretation:

- The relatively narrow resistance range across antibiotics suggests that resistance is not primarily drug-specific.

##### Conclusion:

- Antibiotic choice alone does not strongly influence resistance outcomes; instead, resistance appears to be widespread across multiple antibiotics, indicating systemic antimicrobial pressure.

#### Ward/Infection Site:

##### Findings:

- Surgery ward has highest infection rate.

- Pediatric shows second higher resistance rate.

- General & ICU wards show relatively lower severity

- Respiratory tract has highest sensitivity rate and Urinary tract has highest resistance rate.

##### Interpretation:

- The Surgery ward experiences the highest infection burden, Pediatric wards show elevated resistance risk, while General and ICU wards demonstrate comparatively lower severity, Urinary tract has highest resistance rate.

##### Conclusion:

- The Surgery ward carries the highest infection burden, Pediatric wards exhibit elevated resistance risk, and urinary tract infections show the highest resistance rates overall, while General and ICU wards demonstrate comparatively lower severity—highlighting the need for targeted infection control in surgical, pediatric, and UTI-focused care settings.

#### Age:

##### Findings:

- Mean age ≈ Median age (~46)

- Resistance spread evenly across age groups

- Model did not strongly depend on age

- Resistance rate is highest in 1-25 age group.

##### Interpretation:

- No sharp age-based resistance spike.

##### Conclusion:

-  Age alone has weak influence on resistance.

#### Ranking of factors:

- Antibiotic Name (Strongest)
- Bacteria Name
- Ward / Infection Site
- Age (Weakest)

### Antibiotic with least resistance:

- Tetracycline is the antibiotic with lowest resistance.

- Vancomycin is the antibiotic with highest sensitivity.

#### Conclusion:

- Vancomycin demonstrates the highest effectiveness with maximum sensitivity, while tetracycline shows the lowest resistance—indicating both remain comparatively reliable treatment options in this dataset.

## Summary:-

The analysis shows that bacterial species is the most influential factors in determining antimicrobial resistance, followed by antibiotic name, ward or infection site. Age demonstrates minimal independent influence.

Among the antibiotics studied, Tetracycline exhibits the lowest resistance rate, indicating higher effectiveness, while Meropenam and Ciprofloxacin show comparatively higher resistance.

Higher resistance patterns observed in surgical, pediatrics wards and urinary tract highlight the need for stricter antibiotic stewardship and infection control policies.
