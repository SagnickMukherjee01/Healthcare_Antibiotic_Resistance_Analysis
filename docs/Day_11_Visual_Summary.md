# Resistance Rate vs Age Group

The trend is not linear. The highest overall resistance is seen in the youngest population, 0-18 (36.8%), and the 46-60 group (36.1%). The lowest rates are in the 31-45 (33.9%) and 60+ (33.0%) groups.


# Resistance Rate vs Infection Site

There isn't a massive difference between sites, but Wound infections show the highest overall resistance rate (36.6%), while Bloodstream infections show the lowest (33.5%).


# Heatmap Deep Dive (The Cross-Tabulation)

The heatmap is the most valuable chart as it shows the interaction between both variables.

- ## The Single Hottest Spot:

The most critical problem is Wound infections in the 19-30 age group, which has a 12.1% resistance rate. This is the highest value on the entire chart by a significant margin.

- ## The Single Coldest Spot:

The 19-30 age group also has the lowest resistance rate on the chart: 5.5% for Respiratory infections. This indicates extreme variance within this single age group.

- ## The Most Consistent Problem:

Urinary infections show high resistance across almost all age groups (10.7%, 10.5%, 9.8%, 10.7%). This is a broad, systemic issue, not an isolated one.
