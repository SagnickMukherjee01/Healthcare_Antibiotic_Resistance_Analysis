# Interpretation & Recommendations:

## 1️⃣ Which wards need antibiotic policy changes?

## 2️⃣ Which antibiotics should be avoided or used cautiously?

## 3️⃣ Are there any time/season patterns to watch?

### Which wards need antibiotic policy changes?

#### 📊 Findings:

- Surgery ward → many infections

- Pediatric ward → high resistance

- General & ICU → comparatively lower severity

#### ✅ Interpretation:

- More infections = higher antibiotic exposure

- Higher resistance = greater treatment failure risk

#### 🧠 Recommendation:

Surgery and Pediatric wards must revise antibiotic usage protocols

#### Introduce:

- Antibiotic stewardship rounds

- Regular resistance audits

- Targeted prescribing guidelines

#### 📌 Key point: 

Policy change is needed where damage risk is highest, not everywhere.

### Which antibiotics should be avoided or used cautiously?

#### 📊 Findings:

- Meropenem → highest resistance (36.7%)

- Ciprofloxacin → high resistance for multiple bacteria

- Ceftriaxone → poor performance against E. coli

#### ✅ Interpretation:

These drugs are losing effectiveness.

#### 🧠 Recommendation:

Avoid empirical (blind) use of:

- Meropenem

- Ciprofloxacin

- Ceftriaxone (especially for UTIs)

Use only after:

- Culture & sensitivity testing

- Clear clinical justification

#### 💡 Positive note:

Vancomycin → high sensitivity

Tetracycline → lowest resistance

➡ These remain comparatively reliable in this dataset.

#### Are there any time/season patterns to watch?

#### 📊 Findings:

- Infection levels appear stable across time

- No strong seasonal outbreak pattern detected

#### ✅ Interpretation:

- Resistance is structural, not seasonal

- Driven by:

Antibiotic misuse

Ward practices

Infection site (UTI dominance)

#### 🧠 Recommendation:

- Continuous monitoring is more important than seasonal alerts.

- Monthly or quarterly resistance dashboards recommended.

### 🔹 Data-Driven Recommendations

- Antibiotic policy changes should be prioritized in Surgery and Pediatric wards due to high infection burden and elevated resistance risk.

- Empirical use of Meropenem, Ciprofloxacin, and Ceftriaxone should be minimized, as these antibiotics show consistently high resistance levels across multiple bacteria.

- Vancomycin and Tetracycline remain comparatively effective, showing higher sensitivity and lower resistance rates, and may be preferred when clinically appropriate.

- Urinary tract infections exhibit the highest resistance rates, indicating the need for stricter antibiotic stewardship in UTI management.

- No strong seasonal trends were observed; resistance appears persistent over time, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring rather than seasonal interventions.
