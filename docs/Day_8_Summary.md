# Pivot name: Bacteria_Site_Pivot

## Purpose: To analyze how often each bacteria is isolated from different infection sites.

## 🔍 1️⃣ Overall Distribution

The total isolates are 1000, spread across 4 major infection sites.

The Urinary tract has the highest number of infections (268 cases, 26.8%).

The Bloodstream has the lowest (227 cases, 22.7%), but still significant.

## ✅ Insight: Urinary infections are the most common source of bacterial isolates in this dataset.

## 🔍 2️⃣ Most Common Bacteria Overall

Escherichia coli (E. coli) has the highest total count – 179 isolates (17.9%).

Followed by Enterococcus faecalis (177) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (170).

## ✅ Insight: E. coli remains the most frequent pathogen across all infection types — consistent with clinical patterns (often found in UTIs).

## 🔍 3️⃣ Site-specific Dominance

## ✅ Insight:
Different bacteria dominate different sites — a key clinical insight for antibiotic policy design.

## 🔍 4️⃣ Diversity Observation

Each site shows contributions from multiple bacteria → no single bacteria dominates entirely.

The distribution is relatively balanced, showing multi-bacterial infection risk in hospitals.

## ✅ Insight: Infection control should address multiple pathogens simultaneously, not just one.

## 🧠 Pivot Table Recap

## 🔍 1️⃣ Overall Pattern

Across all antibiotics:

Resistant (R): ~35%

Sensitive (S): ~55%

Intermediate (I): ~10%

## ✅ Insight: Around one-third of bacterial isolates show resistance — a concerning level indicating growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
More than half are still sensitive, suggesting treatment options are available but require careful choice.

## 🔍 2️⃣ Most Effective Antibiotic (Highest Sensitivity %)

Vancomycin shows the highest sensitivity rate: 58.2%.

Close behind: Tetracycline (56.4%) and Amoxicillin (56%).

## ✅ Insight: Vancomycin remains the most effective antibiotic in this dataset, making it a strong choice for resistant Gram-positive infections.

## 🔍 3️⃣ Least Effective Antibiotic (Highest Resistance %)

Meropenem has the highest resistance rate: 36.7%, followed closely by Ciprofloxacin (35.4%).

Carbapenem resistance (like Meropenem) is especially alarming, since it’s often the “last-resort” drug.

## ✅ Insight: Meropenem resistance indicates emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains — a serious clinical concern.

## 🔍 4️⃣ Moderate Resistance Across the Board

Resistance rates for most antibiotics range from 33–37%, showing no antibiotic is completely safe from resistance.

The Intermediate (I) category (~10%) suggests partial susceptibility — could improve with dose optimization.

## ✅ Insight: Continuous monitoring is essential; rotating or combining antibiotics may reduce further resistance development.

## 🧮 Pivot Recap: Ward vs Patient Count

![Capture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78c81349-1fb4-4a4f-b5fd-35c2ac72d890)

## 🔍 1️⃣ Overall Patient Distribution

Total patients analyzed: 1200

The distribution across wards is fairly balanced, with each ward handling around 24–26% of total patients.

## ✅ Insight: Patient load is well distributed, showing that no single ward is overburdened.

## 🔍 2️⃣ Highest Patient Load

Surgery Ward has the highest number of patients (315) — about 26.3% of total.

## ✅ Insight: The surgery department experiences the highest admission rate, likely due to post-operative care and trauma cases.

## 🔍 3️⃣ Lowest Patient Load

ICU has the lowest count (291) — roughly 24.2% of total.

## ✅ Insight: Slightly fewer patients in ICU may reflect either effective triage or limited critical cases during the study period.

## 🔍 4️⃣ Pediatric and General Wards

Both Pediatric (292) and General (302) have moderate patient loads, showing balanced utilization of general and child care facilities.

## ✅ Insight: Indicates healthy hospital capacity management across both adult and child patients.
